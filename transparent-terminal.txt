At some point Gnome (or rather, libvte, on which gnome-terminal is based) removed transparency b/c maintaining it was too burdensome, or something like that. So it is gone from Debian 8.

I recommend installing the devilspie2 package.

Put the following into ~/.config/devilspie2/gnome-terminal.lua:

if (get_window_class()=="Gnome-terminal") then
   set_opacity(0.95);
end

Then put the following into ~/.config/autostart/devilspie2.desktop:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Devilspie2
Type=Application
TryExec=devilspie2
Exec=devilspie2
StartupNotify=false
Terminal=false

Re-login and enjoy. Tweak the opacity value from 0 to 1 to taste. (You can kill the devilspie2 process and run it from the terminal to test configurations.)

Then start learning devilspie2 (and Lua scripting) b/c you can now start messing w/ transparency and a tonne of other window features programmatically for any X program.
