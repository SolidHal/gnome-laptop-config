To use spacemacs quickly from the terminal like nano or vim, you need to daemonize it.
em.sh <filename> will open spacemacs in the terminal, and start a background daemon if necessary.
If no file is given, it will open to scratch

rebind space q q to kill the frame instead of the server by putting this int .spacemacs user-config


  (evil-leader/set-key "q q" 'spacemacs/frame-killer)

spacemacs server/daemon can then be killed with space q Q

alias em.sh to em for ease of use and throw em.sh into /usr/local/bin
