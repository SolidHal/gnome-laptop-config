You can use dconf(1) to dump and load the gnome-terminal profiles.

To export all of your gnome-terminal profiles from one system, and then load them on another, you would issue the following:

source system:

 dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/ > gnome-terminal-profiles.dconf

destination system (after transferring the gnome-terminal-profiles.dconf file):

 dconf load /org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/ < gnome-terminal-profiles.dconf


make sure to disable the menu bar in the terminal preferences
